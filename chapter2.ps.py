#Q1 Write a python program to add two numbers.
a = 2
b = 3
print("number a is:",a)
print("number b is:",b)
print("sum is ", a+b)

#Q2 Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.
c = 34
z = 5
print("remainder if devided ", c%z)

# Q3 Check the type of variable assigned using input () function.

a = input("enter the value:")
print (" the value is:",a)
# b = int(a)
t = type(a)
print(t)

# refer Q3 if we have to change the type in input vaule only how we change so let go i will tell
d= input("enter the value:")
print (" the value is:",d)
n= int(d)
t = type(n)
print(t)

#Q4  Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than
# ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80

a = 34 
b = 80 
# c = a>b
print("a is greater than b:",a>b)

#Q5 Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user
a = int(input("Enter the value1:"))
b = int(input("Enter the value2:"))
print("the number 1 is :",a)
print("the number 2 is :",b)
print("the avrage of that number",(a+b)/2)

# . Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.

a = int(input("Enter the numbre"))
print("the number is :",a)
print("the answer is:", a*a)
